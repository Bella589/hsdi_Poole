<h2> Introduction</h2>
  <p>Ana Roqué de Duprey was born on April 18, 1853 in Puerto Rico. She started a school in her home at the age of thirteen, and wrote a geography textbook for her students, which was later adopted by the Department of Education of Puerto Rico. Roqué had a passion for astronomy and education, founding several girls-only schools as well as the College of Mayagüez, which later became the Mayagüez Campus of the University of Puerto Rico. Roqué wrote the Botany of the Antilles, the most comprehensive study of flora in the Caribbean at the beginning of the 20th century, and was also instrumental in the fight for the Puerto Rican woman’s right to vote.</p>
 
<h2> Early Life</h2>
  <p>Roqué was born Ana Roqué Geigel on April 18, 1853 in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. Roqué’s mother, a teacher, taught her how to write by the age of three. Roqué’s mother soon died, but her father, aunt, and grandmother, who were also educators, continued to foster her love of learning. Her father sent her to private school at the age of seven, where Roqué studied at twice the rate of her peers, graduating when she was nine. Roqué then studied at home, concentrating in the sciences.</p>
  <p>She studied botany, zoology, astronomy, geology, and meteorology. At eleven, Roqué became a teacher’s assistant and at thirteen, she opened her own school from her home. She wrote the geography textbook she taught from, and it became a reference for local schools.</p>

  <h2> Personal Life</h2>
  <p>In 1872, Roqué married Luis Duprey, a well-off landowner and slaveowner. As a condition for her marriage, Roqué requested that she be permitted to educate the enslaved persons and that they not be forced to bow before their masters.</p>
  <p>She and Duprey had five children, though only three survived into adulthood. The family moved to San Juan in 1878. Duprey died two years later, leaving her a widow with young children.</p>
  <h2> Educating </h2>
  <p>Roqué took a teaching position in Arecibo, a municipality fifty miles west of San Juan. She also earned her bachelor’s degree in philosophy and science in this period. In 1893, Roqué founded the newspaper La Mujer (“The Woman”), the first publication on the island designed specifically for women. She also wrote for newspapers such as El Mundo, El Buscapie, and El Imparcial, and published several books, including Sara, La Obrera (“The Female Worker”), and Luz y Sombra (“Light & Shadow”). She would go on to found several more publications, both for women and general audiences, such as La Evolucion, La Mujer del Sigio XX, Album Puertorrigueño, and Heraldo de la Mujer.</p>
  <h2> Awards</h2>
  <p>In 1932, Roqué received an honorary doctorate from the University of Puerto Rico. A high school in Humacao, Puerto Rico was named after her, as was a former elementary school in Chicago. Roqué also holds the distinction of being the first woman allowed to enter the Puerto Rican Athenaeum, an elite cultural institution devoted to Puerto Rican arts, music, and literature. Roqué died in Río Piedras in 1933.</p>
