  <h2> Early Life</h2>
  <p>Dr. Ruth Rogan Benerito (1916 – 2013); BS 1935 Newcomb College (Chemistry); MS 1938 Tulane University (Chemistry);
    PhD 1948 University of Chicago (Physical Chemistry); Inventor of wrinkle, stain and flame resistant cotton, and
    holder of fifty five patents for inventions</p>

  <p>Ruth Mary Rogan Benerito was born and raised in New Orleans by parents who believed very strongly in women’s rights
    and education. During a time when very few women studied science, Ruth entered Newcomb College at 15, ready to
    pursue a degree in mathematics. She quickly discovered that she was better suited to a career in chemistry and
    graduated at age 19 in 1935 with a bachelor’s degree in the field from Newcomb. After spending a year in graduate
    studies at Bryn Mawr College, she returned to New Orleans to continue her education by earning a master’s degree in
    chemistry from Tulane in 1938 — she was one of only two women allowed to take physical chemistry classes — and then
    traveled to the University of Chicago for her Ph.D, also in chemistry, in 1948.</p>

  <h2> Personal Life </h2>
  <p>Ruth married a lifelong acquaintance, Frank Penchot Benerito, in August 1950. He was a WWII veteran who was in the
    automobile business, and he wholeheartedly believed in a woman’s right to plan her own life, and he supported Ruth’s
    research goals and her work ethic.

    In 1953, Ruth began working at the U. S. Department of Agriculture Southern Regional Research Laboratories in New
    Orleans. Early in her career at the USDA, she developed the “fat emulsion” process, a way to feed fat intravenously
    to Korean War soldiers, a technique that has saved countless lives.</p>

  <h2> Discoveries</h2>
  <p>Following that, she began working in the USDA’s chemical cotton reactions laboratory, where she led a team that
    discovered a way to chemically treat the surface of cotton — leading not only to wrinkle-resistant fabric but also
    to stain- and flame-resistant fabrics. During an era of significant scientific and technological inventions, Ruth’s
    discovery was one of the most important — it revolutionized the life of the average homemaker by simplifying and
    speeding up laundry duties. Ruth also helped revive the cotton industry, which had suffered with the introduction of
    synthetic fibers (such as nylon and polyester) that did not need to be ironed. </p>
