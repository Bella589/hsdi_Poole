    <h2> Early Years</h2>
    <p>Lovelace had an unusual upbringing for an aristocratic girl in the mid-1800s. At her mother's insistence, tutors
      taught her mathematics and science. Such challenging subjects were not standard fare for women at the time, but
      her mother believed that engaging in rigorous studies would prevent Lovelace from developing her father's moody
      and unpredictable temperament. Lovelace was also forced to lie still for extended periods of time because her
      mother believed it would help her develop self-control.
    </p>
    <h2>Studies</h2>
    <p>
      Around the age of seventeen, Ada met Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor. The pair became friends, and the much
      older Babbage served as a mentor to Lovelace. Through Babbage, Lovelace began studying advanced mathematics with
      University of London professor Augustus de Morgan. Lovelace was fascinated by Babbage's ideas. Known as the father
      of the computer, he invented the difference engine, which was meant to perform mathematical calculations. Lovelace
      got a chance to look at the machine before it was finished, and was captivated by it. Babbage also created plans
      for another device known as the analytical engine, designed to handle more complex calculations.
    </p>
    <h2> Personal Life</h2>
    <p>
      In 1835, Lovelace married William King, who became the Earl of Lovelace three years later. She then took the title of Countess of Lovelace. They shared a love of horses and had three children together. From most accounts, he supported his wife's academic endeavors. Lovelace and her husband socialized with many of the interesting minds of the times, including scientist Michael Faraday and writer Charles Dickens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lovelace's health suffered. She had lingering problems with asthma and her digestive system. Doctors gave her painkillers, such as laudanum and opium, and her personality began to change. She reportedly experienced mood swings and hallucinations.

    <h2>Lovelace's Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Lovelace's contributions to the field of computer science were not discovered until the 1950s. Her notes were
      reintroduced to the world by B.V. Bowden, who republished them in Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital
      Computing Machines in 1953. Since then, Ada has received many posthumous honors for her work. In 1980, the U.S.
      Department of Defense named a newly developed computer language "Ada," after Lovelace.
